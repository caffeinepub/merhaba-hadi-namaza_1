# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the duplicate time offset adjustment component from the homepage.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the "Saat Düzeltmesi" (Clock Adjustment) UI component from the homepage, including the offset input control and current adjustment display
- Ensure the Settings page retains the time offset adjustment functionality unchanged
- Adjust homepage layout to eliminate any visual gaps after component removal

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage no longer displays the time offset adjustment controls, eliminating the duplicate interface since this functionality is already available in the Settings page.
