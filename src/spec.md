## Summary
**Goal:** Implement comprehensive responsive design across the entire Hadi Namaza application to ensure optimal display and usability on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers.

**Planned changes:**
- Make location selection modal responsive and properly sized for mobile devices
- Implement responsive layouts for all screens using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Make typography responsive across all components using Tailwind's responsive text utilities
- Ensure all buttons, input fields, and interactive elements have appropriate sizing and touch targets for mobile
- Adjust spacing (padding, margins, gaps) to be responsive across all breakpoints
- Make prayer times display section responsive for all device sizes
- Make tab navigation and overflow menu responsive with appropriate touch targets
- Make all modal dialogs and cards responsive across breakpoints

**User-visible outcome:** Users will experience a fully responsive application that adapts seamlessly to their device screen size, with properly sized touch targets on mobile, readable text at all breakpoints, and well-organized content whether viewing on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
