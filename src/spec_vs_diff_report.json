  "summary": "Weekly Prayer Times table markup was updated to add wrapper/table/sticky-column class hooks for a sticky first column in both header and body. Global CSS was also modified substantially, including theme/palette and background utilities that appear unrelated to the specific mobile table overlap fix request.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Large-scale global theme/palette changes (OKLCH color tokens for background/foreground/primary/etc.) beyond the weekly table scroll/overlap fix.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest constrained changes to fixing the weekly table mobile scroll/overlap issue only; global palette updates are unrelated to sticky column behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css"

    },
    {
      "description": "Added/modified global background utilities for Islamic pattern images (pattern-bg, vivid-motif-bg).",
      "reason": "Not requested; also violates the 'no unrelated UI changes' constraint since it changes global styling/background capabilities unrelated to the weekly table overlap bug.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced/expanded pastel prayer-time column color utilities/tokens (e.g., --prayer-imsak, .prayer-imsak-col, etc.).",
      "reason": "While the table uses prayer-*-col classes, the BuildRequest did not ask to add/alter column color theming—only to fix sticky/scroll overlap and separation.",
