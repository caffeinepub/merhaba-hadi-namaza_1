  "summary": "Diff adds a new Ramadan checklist UI section in the Fasting Tracker tab, stores a 30-boolean completion array in app settings, and updates localStorage schema/versioning with migrations and defaults. Styling uses existing UI components and a responsive grid.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Checklist items should be explicitly labeled “Day 1 … Day 30” (exact 30 individually toggleable day items).",
      "reason": "The new checklist renders 30 items and shows the day number (1–30), but the visible label is only the number, not “Day X” as stated in the acceptance criteria wording.",
