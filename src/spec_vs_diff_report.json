  "summary": "The diff does not provide concrete evidence that the Weekly Prayer Times table was updated to use a sticky first (Day/Date) column with proper scroll container behavior, consistent header/body styling, opaque backgrounds, and separators. The visible changes are largely global theme/style changes (palette, backgrounds, prayer-color tokens) and metadata/summaries, which go beyond the requested narrow table-overlap fix.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the Weekly Prayer Times table on mobile so horizontal scrolling does not cause the left Day/Date column to overlap/merge with time columns; first column stays fixed, opaque, and separated while table scrolls inside its own container.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows changes to the Weekly Prayer Times table markup/container (e.g., scroll wrapper with horizontal overflow) or to the specific header/body first-column cells to make them sticky with opaque background and a separator. The only concrete code shown is global CSS variable/theme changes; the table-specific utilities mentioned in the summary are not visible in the truncated diff.",

      "requirement": "Ensure sticky-column styling is consistent for both header and body cells (position: sticky; left: 0; consistent background + separator), correct z-index layering, and today-row styling remains readable.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows coordinated header+body sticky styling, explicit z-index layering applied to the weekly table header/body sticky cells, or handling for today-row styling. The only mention is in a generated summary file, not in verifiable code changes within the provided diff snippet.",
