  "summary": "The diff primarily updates the Namaz Öğretici UI logic in NamazOgreticiTab.tsx to defensively handle step bounds when switching gender flows and to add swipe navigation. However, the core requested rebuild—new PDF-aligned step datasets and the replacement illustration asset set under frontend/public/assets/generated—is not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Rebuild the entire “Namaz Öğretici” tutorial content for BOTH men and women from scratch to match the authoritative PDF (Turkey Hanafi), including step ordering and step text.",
      "reason": "No changes are shown to the tutorial content datasets themselves (titles/descriptions/arabicText/order/count) that would demonstrate a from-scratch PDF-aligned rebuild for men and women.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not include any modification to frontend/src/features/namaz-ogretici/namazTutorialContent.ts, so the rebuilt step lists and new imagePath values are not evidenced.",

      "reason": "Some out-of-range protection and swipe handling are implemented, but the diff is truncated and does not provide evidence that dot navigation and the step indicator (current/total) fully reflect the new step counts across both flows.",
