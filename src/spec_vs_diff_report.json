  "summary": "REQ-2 (web safe-area padding) appears implemented via new CSS utilities using env(safe-area-inset-*) and applying a safe-area class at the top-level App container. REQ-1 (complete Android WebView wrapper guide with full copy-pasteable file-by-file code) cannot be confirmed from the truncated doc content; the diff excerpt shows only introductory sections and does not provide evidence of the required complete, sequential file listings/code blocks. Several unrelated styling/theme changes and meta/tracking file edits appear added beyond the requested safe-area support and documentation expansion.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Expand `frontend/docs/android-webview-template.md` into a complete, final Android Studio WebView wrapper guide with full Kotlin/Gradle/manifest/resource code (copy-pasteable, file-by-file), including offline caching, JS bridge contracts, Android 13+ notification permission + settings intent, scheduled prayer alarms + ongoing notification, Play Store version checking + update notification, and WindowInsets handling.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows only the beginning of the document (overview/prerequisites/project structure header) and does not provide evidence of the required file-by-file sectioned layout with complete code blocks for the manifest, Gradle files, Kotlin classes (MainActivity/WebAppInterface/receivers/helpers/services), XML resources, permission flow code, alarm scheduling, ongoing notification, or Play Store version checking implementation details. Because the file content is truncated and the visible excerpt does not include those sections, the acceptance criteria cannot be verified as implemented.",
